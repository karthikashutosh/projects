## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

To check if you have Node.js installed, open your terminal and run:

```
node --version
```

If you need to install Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Running the App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-gallery-react-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd zania-assignment
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should now see the Cat Gallery app running!

## Using the App

Once the app is running, you can:

- View a grid of cat images
- Click on an image to see more details in an overlay
- Drag and drop images to reorder them
- The app automatically saves your changes every few seconds

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you're using a compatible version of Node.js
2. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
3. Check the console in your web browser for any error messages


Our Front-End Approach
We've designed this Cat Gallery app with several key principles in mind:

React for Interactivity: We chose React as our front-end framework because it excels at creating interactive user interfaces. This is crucial for features like drag-and-drop reordering and dynamic updates.
Component-Based Architecture: The app is built using reusable components (like the cat image cards and the overlay), making the code more maintainable and easier to update.
State Management: We use React's built-in state management (useState and useEffect hooks) to handle the app's data and side effects. This approach keeps our app simple and avoids the overhead of additional state management libraries for this scale of application.
Optimized Performance: We've implemented techniques like memoization to ensure the app remains responsive even with a large number of cat images.
Automatic Saving: The app automatically saves changes every few seconds, providing a seamless user experience without the need for manual saving.
Error Handling: We've implemented error states to gracefully handle issues like failed data fetches, improving the app's reliability.
Loading States: Loading spinners are used to provide visual feedback during data fetching and saving operations, enhancing the perceived performance of the app.

This approach allows us to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly cat gallery that's also maintainable and extensible for future development.
